# Overview
## What is DAWG?
First and foremost, `DAWG` is a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). It strives to provide all of the features expected out of a modern workstation while providing flexibility, extensibility, and new technology that leverages recent advances in machine learning.

## Should you use DAWG?
`DAWG` is in its early stages of development and is still missing a lot of small features that are present in DAWs such as [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/) and [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/). The features that do exist are not yet stable and may change at any time. Furthermore, `DAWG` still contains lots of hidden bugs that we have not found yet. If your adventurous and want to try something new, `DAWG` is for you.
