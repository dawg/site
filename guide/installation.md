Downloading and installing `Vusic` should only take a few minutes. It is a fairly small file (compared to other DAWs) sitting at a mere `93.2 MB`.

::: warning
Building cross-platform is not as easy as it may seem. Therefore, we only support Linux at the moment until we can configure our pipelines to build `Vusic` for `Windows` and `MacOS`.

## System Requirements
`Vusic` is lightweight and should run on most available hardware and platform versions. Since we are running `Google Chrome` behind the hood, you can reference their [system requirements page](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7100626?hl=en) for accurate information.
