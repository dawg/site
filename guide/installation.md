Downloading and installing `Vusic` should only take a few minutes. It is a fairly small file (compared to other DAWs) sitting at less than `100 MB`.

## System Requirements
`Vusic` is kinda lightweight (compared to other DAWs) and should run on most available hardware and platform versions. Since we are running `Google Chrome` under the hood, you can reference their [system requirements page](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7100626?hl=en) for accurate information.
